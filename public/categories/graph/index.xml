      <description>For those of you that don&amp;rsquo;t know me, I have a lot of weird hobbies, one of those is playing a nearly 30 year old text-based Role Playing Game (RPG). Archaic by most gamer&amp;rsquo;s standards, the world is vastly different than most games, instead of being defined as an open map or grid, it is actually a directed graph.
A Little Background The entirety of the graph is the World and the smallest component or node is known as a Room.</description>
