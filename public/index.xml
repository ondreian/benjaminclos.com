      <description>For awhile I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling to keeping up with my personal writing, mainly because I was not very happy with my toolchain which made getting to the point of creating content feel more like a chore than it should have.
A few friends of mine were chatting about how they have recently switched to the Hugo static site generator, and it seemed like it might be worth a chance. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of static websites and authoring via Markdown, so I hope this helps to reduce my activation energy for talking about my experiences.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing code professionally for over 10 years, but I started 18 years ago for fun. During that timeframe I have worked on quite a few personal to professional projects here are my top three ranked for coolness and recency:
Native Company: Flowplayer Tech: Javascript, SASS, Video This project consisted of a greenfield rewrite of an incredibly popular video player, where I was given several goals: a powerful api, fast performance, and reducing bundled size.</description>
