excerpt: how I chose the current stack for my blog and personal website.

I recently decided to revamp my blog, in an attempt to streamline my workflow for blogging and come up with my desired features:

  * statically compiled blog posts
  * a tag system
  * a draft system
  * Disqus support
  * interoperability with the Brunch ecosystem
