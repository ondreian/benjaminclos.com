For awhile I've been struggling to keeping up with my personal writing, mainly because I was not very happy with my toolchain which made getting to the point of creating content feel more like a chore than it should have.

A few friends of mine were chatting about how they have recently switched to the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator, and it seemed like it might be worth a chance.  I'm a big fan of static websites and authoring via Markdown, so I hope this helps to reduce my activation energy for talking about my experiences.
