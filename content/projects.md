I've been writing code professionally for over 10 years, but I started 18 years ago for fun. 
During that timeframe I have worked on quite a few personal to professional projects here are my top three ranked for coolness and recency:

---

### Native
#### Company: Flowplayer
#### Tech: Javascript, SASS, Video

This [project](https://flowplayer.com/native) consisted of a greenfield rewrite of an incredibly popular [video player](https://github.com/flowplayer/flowplayer), where I was given several goals: a powerful api, fast performance, and reducing bundled size.

This was probably one of my favorite projects to work on. The modern web is [full of bloat](https://www.wired.com/2016/04/average-webpage-now-size-original-doom/) and it was refreshing to see a company actively trying to reduce it.  It was a lot of work and felt like for every two LOC added I worked to trim three, but after the project went into general availability for Enterprise customers we had the most fastest and smallest (~10kb gzipped) HTML5 Video player on the market.

### P2P Hybrid Video Distribution
#### Company: Flowplayer
#### Tech: Javascript, HLS, Node.js

This project was a peer-to-peer hybrid (P2P/CDN) video delivery system based on the [HLS protocol](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/). It involved implementing an insect-based routing system a P2P and peer signaling service.  I can't talk much more about it, but in production networks it demonstrated a 20% reduction in CDN usage.

### Elanthia Online Project
#### Personal
#### Tech: Ruby

My nerdiest project consists of writing a public toolchain to help improve scripting in a text-based RPG called [Gemstone IV](https://play.net/gsiv).  It uses [Github](https://github.com/elanthia-online/scripts) and [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/elanthia-online/scripts) that accepts community contributions and publishes them to a remote script repository via a machine user.  Previously it had been a persistent community problem where there was no good mechanism for collaboratively authoring scripts.

## Technologies

Here are some of the technologies I am most comfortable with:

1. Javascript & Node.js
2. CSS/SASS & Other CSS preprocessors
3. Ruby
4. Postgres

And a few more I really like to tinker in but have limited professional experience with:

1. [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
2. [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)
3. [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)
