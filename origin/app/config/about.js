During my younger years I played a lot of tennis, and still play on occassion, though my preference has shifted to soccer these days. I have a small, but growing collection of bonsai, carnivorous plants, and orchids. "

    , text  : "During high school I was lucky enough to take a class on javascript, and found it incredibly interesting. In college, I furthered my coding skills and taught myself more about web development as I studied business. My self-taught, nontraditional education in web development would not have been possible without the hard work of a lot of open source contributions which taught me an even more important skill, how to teach myself anything. As a product of those contributions, I try to keep that knowledge growing through publising codebases I've found useful, and sending pull requests when I feel I can contribute."
